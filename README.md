# Dice_Game_Vivado
# The game involves two dice, each of which can have a value between 1 and 6.Two counters are used to simulate the roll of the dice.
# Each counter counts in the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2,... Thus, after the “roll” of the dice, the
sum of the values in the two counters will be in the range 2 through 12.The rules of the game are
as follows:
• After the first roll of the dice, the player wins if the sum is 7 or 11. The player loses if the
sum is 2, 3, or 12. Otherwise, the sum the player obtained on the first roll is referred to as
a reference point, and he or she must roll the dice again.
• On the second or subsequent roll of the dice, the player wins if the sum equals the reference
point, and he or she loses if the sum is 7. Otherwise, the player must roll again until he or
she finally wins or loses.
